# Example Mod

Welcome to the example mod, this mod will:

1. Unlock the Pirate faction (selectable in the American Region)
2. Add in a single new "Stick Man" unit (complete with customised strings).
3. Add in a faction trait for the Pirate Faction (viewable on the faction select screen).

To install the mod you should place all three files inside the `FeralEmpireMods` on your phone making sure you own the expansion. You can download the example mod here: 

Your FeralEmpireMods folder should look like this:

Once installed you can launch the game, if you have followed the instructions correctly you will be greeted with a warning that you are running a mod so any issues are not supported by Feral (you should contact the person making the mod).

When you start a new campaign and go to the American theater you'll see a pirates flag on the map.

If you tap and hold on the "National Traits" for the Pirates you'll see the custom faction trait.

If you go to Play Battle -> Land Battles you will see the Pirate faction, if you check the units you will find a new Stickman unit with extremely powerful statistics!

A few important notes for making your own mod you can notice from this mod.

1. It's usually better to pack your entire mod into a single pack file to make it easier to install.
2. Mods only need to contain the files you have modified or added. The example mod is under 1 Megabyte in size. Make sure when extracting data from base game packs you only repack the files you've edited. Users will thank you by keeping your mod size down!
3. Like with data packs you only need to add strings you'd modified in your strings file as your file adds/overrides to the default one it doesn't replace it.
