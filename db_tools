# Database Tool Modifications

When using the [etwng database tool](https://github.com/taw/etwng/tree/master/db) tool you need to replace the following files with the ones in this GitHub. These files add support for the updated databases used in the mobile game. Once you download the etwng tool you can then just replace the files and then use the tool with the mobile files.

  * db_pack
  * db_schemata.rb
  * db_unpack
  * DB.xsd
  * schema.xml

  You can download the files here - [EmpireMobileDatabaseChanges.zip](EmpireMobileDatabaseChanges.zip)
